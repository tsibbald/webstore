I prefer to not use Bootstrap as a css library because of the simple fact that it uses to much codespace for the client to load every time. I choose to use as less code possible to gain performance so i will minify everything. Also with applying bootstrap you do not really need to understand how responsiveness works so it won't give a good insight in my understanding, thus i prefer to to write it all myself.

I choose to use sass nested because it creates css representation of the semantic structure of the html document and also with the partials it gives a good overview and it is easy to adjust.
