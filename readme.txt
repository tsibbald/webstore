No bootstrap:
I prefer to not use Bootstrap as a css library because of the simple fact that it uses to much codespace for the client to load every time. I choose to use as less code possible to gain performance so i will minify everything. Also with applying bootstrap you do not really need to understand how responsiveness works so it won't give a good insight in my understanding, thus i prefer to write it myself.

SASS:
I choose to use sass nested because it creates css representation of the semantic structure of the html document and also with the partials it gives a good overview and it is easy to adjust.

Minification: 
The website itself uses the minified scripts, to gain performance.

Angular:
Angularjs is used, because the DOM manipulation (compare to Jquery) is much cleaner, thus easier to understand and adjust.

I chose to use an array with the pictures in the AngularJS controller.js. This array should have also the product information in it the website could also load the product information dynamically, but due to lack of time this is not possible to adjust.

Also the showPhoto() function would have a build in timer who waits for the CSS transicion to finish before firing the function again, but i could not finish this.
